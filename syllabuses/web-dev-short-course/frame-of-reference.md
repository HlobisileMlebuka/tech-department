# Frame of Reference

The web dev short course is a short and intense introduction to full stack web development using modern JavaScript.

Course duration: 6 months. The last 2 months are an internship.

There is a lot of ground to cover so recruits will be encouraged to move forward with free code camp content whenever they have the time to do so. The FCC deadlines marked on this sheet are merely guidelines, ideally the recruits will be way ahead of the deadlines.

If a recruit is way ahead of schedule then that's great. If we can put them onto product teams earlier then we will.

## Month 1

The first month is dedicated to getting the recruits started. They'll be able to gain basic proficiency in specific tooling, get to grips with how Umuzi works, and be given their first coding project.

Recruits will be told all their deadlines up front. As professionals they will need to be able to manage their time so they are expected to do so from Day 1.
