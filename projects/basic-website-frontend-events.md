# Basic DOM events project

This project will be used to edmonstrate your knowledge and understanding of topics covered up until this point.

## Instructions

Make an HTML based puzzle game. Please use standard DOM elements. You will be peanalised if you use canvas elements or any kind of game engine. The reason for this is: we want you spending your time on market relevent skills.

This document suggests a game that you can make. You can make something else if you want to but don't get too fancy or complicated becasue deadlines matter.

## The game

"Memory" is a fun game that you may have played in "real life", with actual paper tiles. It's called that because the main skill in the game is your memory - how well you can remember the position of tiles.

- The user should be presented with a "grid" of face-down tiles
- clicking on a tile "flips" it over, revealing a picture or symbol

## Bonus:

- allow a multi-player mode in which two users can take turns using the mouse to click on tiles
- allow users to specify the size of the grid
- allow users to specify the difficulty of the game - this should change the pictures on the tiles in different ways
