      <description>The web dev short course is a short and intense introduction to full stack web development using modern JavaScript.
Course duration: 6 months. The last 2 months are an internship.
There is a lot of ground to cover so recruits will be encouraged to move forward with free code camp content whenever they have the time to do so. The FCC deadlines marked on this sheet are merely guidelines, ideally the recruits will be way ahead of the deadlines.</description>
