Here is an example of a memory game:

## Questions

- What dom elements could you use to make a game like this?
- What kinds of JavaScript frontend events would you use?
- How can you make the game more interesting?
  - multi-player?
  - different symbol sets?
  - configurable sizes?
  - authentication?
  - multi-player over netwrk using sockets?
  - memory league? Who has the best memory?

## Instructions

Create a Memory game MVP. Requirements:

- make use of simple dom elements, no fancy graphics needed or canvas stuff
- a single player can play the game
- no time limit
- board is a pre-defined size
- board allows one set of symbols to be randomly hidden

Or if this seems like a boring game to you then do something else.  But talk to us first. And make the MVP first!

## Submission

- Make sure you follow good coding practices, your code should be readable. Your code should be in a git repo with a sensible name.
- Before you submit your code to us for review, you are expected to review each other's code. We will decide who reviews whos code
- Once your code has passed review then senior umuzi staff will review your code
- we will then have a workshop in which we go over any common mistakes and highlight anything excellent

## Note

This project will be multiple phases. We will ask you to implement different features over time. We will also mix things up a bit and get you to implement features on other people's games. So be kind to your colleagues and write clear code!
