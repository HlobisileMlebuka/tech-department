Product teams are teams of no more than 6 recruits guided by a product owner (Umuzi staff). The teams use the Scrum methodology to build real-world, web-based products. Recruits learn additional frameworks (e.g. Django) and packages as needed for the products.

## Additional learning

In addition to the curriculum listed above, the recruits participate in workshops given by industry professionals and Umuzi staff. Generally there are 2-3 workshops each month. Topics include time management, public speaking, networking, preparing for technical interviews, introduction to new frameworks, tech trends, etc.

Recruits are also encouraged to attend industry meetups, conferences, and hackathons. On average, recruits attend 1 meetup/conference per month and 1-2 hackathons during their time at Umuzi.
