Implement the following user story on your code-review-buddy's game:

As a user I want to be able to choose the dimensions of the grid each time I play the game. For example I might want to play on a 2x2 grid or a 3x2 grid. 

## Use Git!

At this point you should be comfortable with using Git from the command line. 

Make a Git branch for your new work and make sure to `push` your latest code atleast daily. You should submit your work as a pull request on your buddy's repo, your buddy will review your code before merging it. 


## Questions about Git?

Please ask one of our junior facilitators first. If they can't help then ask one of the senior managers.
